SyncAndDine is a fun and interactive app for friends and couples to discover the perfect restaurant together. Inspired by the swiping feature from dating apps, SyncAndDine allows users to swipe through restaurant options, like or dislike them, and find their ideal dining experience based on mutual preferences.

## Features

- **Tinder-Style Swiping**: Swipe right (like) or left (dislike) on restaurant options.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: The app suggests restaurants based on both users' swipes and preferences.
- **User Profiles**: Each user can save their preferences and see their swiped history.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Both users' choices are taken into account to generate the best dining options.
- **Flask Backend**: The backend is built with Flask to handle restaurant swipes and recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: In-memory data storage for demonstration (can be extended to use a database like SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Hosting**: Done on pythonanywhere.com. Can also be deployed locally.
